# SecNode Project Refactoring Requirements Document

## Project Overview

Refactor the SecNode project by removing cloud functionality, organizing test file structure, optimizing duplicate code, and improving project maintainability and code quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Cloud Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove cloud dependency features to make the project more lightweight and independent, reducing external dependencies and potential privacy risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing cloud functionality THEN the system should remove all CloudSyncer related code
2. WHEN removing cloud functionality THEN the system should remove aiohttp and other cloud-related dependencies
3. WHEN removing cloud functionality THEN the system should update all code that references CloudSyncer
4. WHEN removing cloud functionality THEN the system should maintain core security policy functionality intact
5. WHEN removing cloud functionality THEN the system should update documentation and example code

### Requirement 2: Organize Test File Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear test file structure that is easy to maintain and run tests, improving development efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing test files THEN all test files should be unified under the tests/ directory
2. WHEN organizing test files THEN test files should be organized by functional modules
3. WHEN organizing test files THEN scattered test files in the root directory should be removed
4. WHEN organizing test files THEN a unified test configuration file should be created
5. WHEN organizing test files THEN all tests should run normally

### Requirement 3: Optimize Duplicate Code

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reduce code duplication, improve code reusability, and lower maintenance costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing duplicate code THEN common test utility functions should be extracted
2. WHEN optimizing duplicate code THEN exception handling patterns should be unified
3. WHEN optimizing duplicate code THEN duplicate logic in policy classes should be optimized
4. WHEN optimizing duplicate code THEN common configuration and constant files should be created
5. WHEN optimizing duplicate code THEN code reuse rate should be significantly improved

### Requirement 4: Update Project Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want project configuration files to reflect the latest dependency and structural changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating project configuration THEN pyproject.toml should remove cloud-related dependencies
2. WHEN updating project configuration THEN __init__.py should remove CloudSyncer exports
3. WHEN updating project configuration THEN README.md should remove cloud functionality related documentation
4. WHEN updating project configuration THEN backward compatibility should be maintained
