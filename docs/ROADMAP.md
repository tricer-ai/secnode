# SecNode Development Roadmap

**Vision: Making AI Agent Security Extremely Simple**

> Transform SecNode from a powerful but complex security framework into the most developer-friendly AI security solution that anyone can use in under 5 minutes.

## Current Status Assessment

### Project Maturity: 60% Complete

| Component | Status | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Core Functionality** | Excellent | 85% | Solid policy framework, 10+ built-in policies |
| **User Experience** | Poor | 30% | Complex configuration, steep learning curve |
| **Ease of Use** | Poor | 25% | Requires deep understanding of security concepts |
| **Extensibility** | Excellent | 90% | Well-designed architecture, easy to extend |
| **Documentation** | Needs Work | 40% | Technical but not beginner-friendly |
| **Performance** | Unknown | 50% | No benchmarks, potential bottlenecks |

### Key Strengths
- Robust policy-based architecture
- Comprehensive security coverage (prompt injection, PII, tool control, etc.)
- LangGraph integration
- Type safety and good code quality
- Flexible policy composition (AllOf/AnyOf)

### Critical Gaps
- **Configuration Complexity**: Requires 10+ lines for basic setup
- **Learning Curve**: Users need to understand policies, combinators, state management
- **Error Messages**: Technical jargon instead of helpful guidance
- **Dependencies**: Manual installation of multiple packages
- **Performance**: No optimization for high-concurrency scenarios

## Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation & Simplification
**Goal**: Make SecNode usable in 1 line of code

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Automation
**Goal**: Self-configuring security that adapts to use cases

### Phase 3: Enterprise & Ecosystem
**Goal**: Production-ready with enterprise features

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Simplification
*Target: Q3-Q4 2025 | Priority: Critical*

### 1.1 Zero-Configuration Experience
**Problem**: Current setup requires 10+ lines and deep security knowledge
**Solution**: One-line security activation

```python
# Current (Complex)
from secnode import GuardNode, AllOf, PromptInjectionPolicy, ToolCallWhitelistPolicy
policy = AllOf([
    PromptInjectionPolicy(sensitivity=0.7, block_system_prompts=True),
    ToolCallWhitelistPolicy(['search', 'calculator'], strict_mode=True)
])
guard = GuardNode(policy=policy)

# Target (Simple)
from secnode import SecNode
guard = SecNode.create()  # Intelligent defaults
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `SecNode.create()` factory method with smart defaults
- [ ] Implement automatic environment detection (chatbot, search, enterprise)
- [ ] Add scenario-based presets: `SecNode.for_chatbot()`, `SecNode.for_search()`
- [ ] Build configuration wizard: `SecNode.config_wizard()`

### 1.2 Intelligent Default Configurations
**Problem**: Users don't know which policies to choose or how to configure them
**Solution**: AI-powered configuration recommendations

```python
# Auto-detect optimal configuration
guard = SecNode.auto_configure(
    app_type="chatbot",           # Auto-detected from context
    security_level="balanced",    # Auto-recommended
    performance_target="<10ms"    # Auto-optimized
)
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Build app type detection (analyze imports, function signatures)
- [ ] Create security level recommendation engine
- [ ] Implement performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Add configuration validation and suggestions

### 1.3 Human-Friendly Error Messages
**Problem**: Technical error messages confuse users
**Solution**: Contextual, actionable error messages with solutions

```python
# Current (Technical)
"Tool call whitelist violation: file_tool blocked"

# Target (Human-Friendly)
"File Access Blocked
   
   Why: For security, this AI assistant cannot access files on your system.
   
   What you can do:
   • Use the search tool to find information
   • Try the calculator for math problems
   • Contact admin to whitelist file operations
   
   Need help? Visit: https://secnode.ai/help/file-access"
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `MessageFormatter` class for user-friendly messages
- [ ] Implement multi-language support (EN, ZH, ES, FR)
- [ ] Add contextual help links and suggestions
- [ ] Build error message templates for each policy type

### 1.4 Decorator & Middleware Patterns
**Problem**: Integration requires understanding SecNode internals
**Solution**: Framework-agnostic decorators and middleware

```python
# Decorator Pattern
@SecNode.protect(level="balanced")
def my_agent_function(query: str) -> str:
    return process_query(query)

# Middleware Pattern (FastAPI)
app.add_middleware(SecNode.middleware())

# Context Manager Pattern
with SecNode.protect():
    result = dangerous_operation()
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [x] Implement `@SecNode.protect()` decorator **COMPLETED**
- [x] Add programmatic wrapping with `SecNode.wrap()` **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create scenario-based factory methods **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Create middleware for FastAPI, Flask, Django
- [ ] Add context manager support
- [ ] Build async/await compatibility

### 1.5 Performance Optimization
**Problem**: No performance benchmarks or optimization
**Solution**: Sub-10ms policy evaluation with benchmarking

**Performance Targets**:
- Simple policies: <5ms
- Complex combinations: <10ms
- High-concurrency: 10k+ QPS
- Memory usage: <100MB

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Optimize regex compilation and caching
- [ ] Implement policy result caching
- [ ] Add async policy evaluation
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard

---

## Phase 2: Intelligence & Automation
*Target: Q1-Q2 2026 | Priority: High*

### 2.1 Adaptive Policy Learning
**Problem**: Static policies become outdated and generate false positives
**Solution**: Self-improving security that learns from usage patterns

```python
# Adaptive policies that learn from feedback
adaptive_guard = SecNode.create_adaptive(
    base_config="balanced",
    learning_rate=0.1,
    adaptation_window="7d"
)

# Learns from:
# - False positives (safe actions blocked)
# - False negatives (threats missed)
# - Human approval patterns
# - Cross-tenant threat intelligence
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Build telemetry collection system
- [ ] Implement ML pipeline for pattern recognition
- [ ] Create human-in-the-loop feedback system
- [ ] Add cross-tenant threat intelligence (privacy-preserving)

### 2.2 Visual Configuration Interface
**Problem**: Configuration is code-only, intimidating for non-developers
**Solution**: Web-based configuration interface with real-time preview

```python
# Launch configuration UI
SecNode.configure_ui()  # Opens web interface at localhost:8080
```

**Features**:
- Drag-and-drop policy builder
- Real-time security testing
- Configuration export/import
- Team collaboration features

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Build React-based configuration UI
- [ ] Create policy visualization components
- [ ] Add real-time testing sandbox
- [ ] Implement configuration sharing and templates

### 2.3 Smart Integration Detection
**Problem**: Users struggle with framework-specific integration
**Solution**: Automatic detection and setup for popular frameworks

```python
# Auto-detects LangGraph, LangChain, etc.
SecNode.auto_integrate()  # Automatically configures for detected frameworks
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Build framework detection system
- [ ] Create auto-configuration for LangGraph, LangChain, AutoGen
- [ ] Add integration testing for each framework
- [ ] Build framework-specific optimization

### 2.4 Threat Intelligence Network
**Problem**: Each deployment learns threats in isolation
**Solution**: Federated learning network for emerging threat detection

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Design privacy-preserving threat sharing protocol
- [ ] Build threat intelligence aggregation system
- [ ] Create real-time threat feed integration
- [ ] Add community threat reporting system
